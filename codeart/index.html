        This is just to say at the conference

        I have tweeted
        the thoughts
        that we had 
        this morning
        
        and which 
        you were probably
        saving
        for your talk
        
        Forgive me
        they were pithy
        so object-oriented
        and so lolz

        OO Programmer Valentine
        a poem
        
        If I could write a program,
        Model-Controller-View,
        And all the instance methods
        That would get me next to you,
        You’d better believe
        That’s exactly what I’d do -
        Instead I wrote up
        Nineteen ways
        To make a list to-do!
        
        And if I built a database
        To organize my mind,
        Command it show me all the ways
        That we could be combined,
        I’d run some neat statistics
        Until I was by your side
        Instead I got 
        A schema done
        And then ran out of time!
        
        Life is just an engine
        You feed logic and adjust,
        And your program is so DRY,
        With clever parts you know and trust -
        But looking at old programs 
        We always say - “That one was nuts!”
        So, valentines,
        Screw clever!
        Let’s just have fun
        and love 
        and lust!
    </p>
