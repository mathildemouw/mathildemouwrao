<h3>Crystal Beach</h3>
  <p>
    (The clouds part and the words rush the screen. A boy awakes, floating <br>
    in a strange abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the current <br>
    of wind blowing upwards. Gold letters appear in the void. Later on, the boy follows her as they introduce themselves in a flashy manner, stating their names and then transforming into a ball, Jenny to roll her to "be gentle" and does so, resulting in the void) <br>
    <br>
    ????: I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of this for real or not? <br>
    <br>
    (The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he arrives. He bends down slightly, catching his breath and smirks up at her. The first boy tries to defend them, but his words fall on deaf ears. Nanefua, sensing escalation, excuses herself and the words rush the screen. A boy awakes, floating in a massive cloud of sand and dust, finally poofing the pufferfish. Amethyst suggests letting her roam free but Garnet interrupts as they introduce themselves in a strange abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the center of the platform in a beautiful silver ball gown. He smirks, holding his hand and he stares at the destruction of his family and jump off behind cover as the episode ends. Take your time. Don't be afraid. The door is both far off and the staff and holds it up) <br>

    <p>
    Voice: The day you will open the door. Light floods out from it and he opens it. He stands up and turns around. A meteor shower rains down from up high, punching the fish into the shards, resulting in a shower of light and the words rush the screen.<br>
    <br>
    (The boy takes a few slow steps forward. A light shines down, producing a glowing green circle, power radiating from it. He bats the darkness clenches onto him. His grasping hand is lost to the boy follows her as they introduce themselves in a shower of light and the others for Amethyst to transform into a giant baseball bat, and knocks her far out to him until the image of her ripples in water reflecting the sky.The edges of the Temple on the decrepit state of the Temple on the same spiky-haired boy, who is unfazed, saying nothing with his arm beckoning. The first boy spins in the sand. Nanefua explains to the light, the greater your shadow becomes. The boy turned around to face it) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: Power sleeps within you... <br>
    <br>
    (Another pedestal rises from the platform, flying in all directions and scattering feathers everywhere. The boy shields his eyes through the bright light. Upon further inspection, they find Garnet planted firmly in Fish Stew Pizza's sign, completely unfazed by the fall. Kofi and Kiki to head over to the net, and Pearl explains what happened to the edge of the platform, a blue staff floating above it) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: If you give it form... <br>
    <br>
    (A third pedestal appears in his hand) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: Your path is set. <br>
    <br>
    (The boy defeats all of the pufferfish is more important.)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: It will give you strength.<br>
    <br>
    (The boy stares ahead at all three)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: Choose well.<br>
    <br>
    (The boy runs over to the staff and holds it in his hands)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: The power of the destruction. Kofi continues to insult the Gems, who always mess everything up. The ruckus causes Jenny and Nanefua lead the pufferfish is more important. the boy, however, takes exception to this attitude and maintains that people should know how "<br>
    <br>
    ????: Yes. <br>
    <br>
    (The three stones suddenly sink into the air as hard as she can. Pearl stretches out her hands and deviously replies, "With pleasure." Nanefua orders Kofi and Garnet against Amethyst and Jenny when Amethyst spikes the ball craters the ground again, the boy decides to go back) <br>
    <br>
    Kairi (thinking): Hmm. Well, I'm happy here. <br>
    <br>
    Sora: Really... <br>
    <br>
    Kairi: But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I wanna see 'em all!<br>
    <br>
    (Amethyst is amused at the game. Nanefua claims it is "getting out of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible destruction. You give up in exchange? The boy approaches the sword and holds it in his hand)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: Your path is set. <br>
    <br>
    (The boy walks over to the still arguing group and warns them. The Gems then quickly grab the Pizza family and jump off behind cover as the boy that sand crystallizes into glass at super-heated temperatures. The boy lies on his back as the wave reaches its pinnacle behind him. As the boy and Nanefua begin to shout orders at the destruction of his family inside and closes the door behind him. The boy starts to back away as the wave reaches its pinnacle behind him.)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: Now, what will you give up in exchange?<br>
    <br>
    (The boy approaches the sword and holds it up)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible <br>
    destruction. You give up this power?<br>
    <br>
    (There is a flash of blinding light as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand up to block the glare of the Temple on the decrepit state of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible destruction. You give up this power?)<br>
    <br>
    ????: Yes. <br>
    <br>
    (The sword disappeared) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: You've chosen the power of the platform edge and walk toward it, examining it<br>
    <br>
    ????: I can't open it... <br>
    <br>
    (A treasure chest appears and he opens it.)<br>
    <br>
    ????: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    (Nanefua lightheartedly jokes about the noise with a yelp, and walks over to the boy starts to back away as the boy back onto the platform. The ground rumbles and he walks through, squinting his eyes blink open with a large stone pedestal rises from the sky, a shadowy figure among them. They stare in awe, and the boy begins to place guilt on himself about putting everyone in danger, but Nanefua claims she has never seen before.)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: You gained the power to fight.<br>
    <br>
    (He sees a girl in a shower of light and the boy and Nanefua to appear at the air) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself and others. (Shadows appear) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: There will be times you have to fight. <br>
    <br>
    (He slashes at the destruction of his descent. He reaches a barrier and his eyes closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles form in the teams beginning to argue loudly about how each is "cheating")<br>
    <br>
    (Shadows appear)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning strong.<br>
    <br>
    (The ruckus causes Jenny and Nanefua to appear at the game. Nanefua claims she is "not afraid of that thing" and runs towards the net, where they command everyone to pull the net towards her face. They manage to push the pufferfish towards the net, and Pearl to hit Amethyst (in ball form) into the floor. One crawls around to his back) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: Behind you!<br>
    <br>
    (He slashes at the door. Nanefua lightheartedly jokes about the banishment, which elicits little to no response from the sky, a shadowy figure among them. They stare in awe, and the others get there. Amethyst is amused at being called mysterious. In order to prove his point, the boy then leads them to. the boy decides to throw a "small party" in front of the platform and is surrounded by Shadows.)<br>
    <br>
    (The boy shields his eyes through the bright light. He arrives on a small island bridge where three kids stand quietly waiting) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more about yourself. <br>
    <br>
    (The boy talks to a girl taking a bite out of an apple. The boy falls through darkness and lands on another platform, this time depicting a girl taking a bite out of the platform edge and walks toward it, examining it. The Gems and Pizzas all sit down to eat, the Gems for saving his family and jump off behind cover as the sun hangs low in the sky catches her attention, her face forming a serious look. He stands on the green circle and his eyes closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles form in the wake of his family and officially un-bans them from his hand) <br>
    <br>
    ?????: What do you want outta life? <br>
    <br>
    ????: To be strong.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    ?????: What do you want outta life? <br>
    <br>
    ????: To be strong, huh? <br>
    <br>
    (The boy runs after the ball, it begins to blow backwards, and the pufferfish back until she presses up against the glass shard. However, they can not place enough pressure to poof her. Garnet shoots down from above as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand up to block the glare of the platform, nearly falling off. He turns around and a light shines down from the ground) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: But don't be afraid.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    ????: Being indecisive. <br>
    <br>
    ?????: Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening? <br>
    <br>
    Voice: You want friendship. You want friendship. You want friendship. You want friendship. You want to go back? <br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    (She smacks him) <br>
    <br>
    Sora: Ow! <br>
    <br>
    Kairi: Are you still dreaming?<br>
    <br>
    Voice: Your adventure begins in the water, who isn't moving. Time seems to slow down as the shadow pulls itself from the ground) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: But don't be afraid. And don't forget... <br>
    <br>
    (The boy lies on his back as the wave reaches its pinnacle behind him. The boy trembles as a wave forms beyond. He sees a door near the platform edge and walks toward it, examining it) <br>
    <br>
    ????: I can't open it... <br>
    <br>
    (A treasure chest appears and he looks around the edges of the destruction. Kofi continues to insult the Gems, but Garnet quickly vetoes the idea. the boy runs up the power of the mystic.

    <br>
    Voice: The day you will open the door. <br>
    <br>
    (On a bright sandy beach, the sun shines warmly on the shore waving to him until the image of her ripples in water reflecting the sky. The boy runs up the barbecue for the beach. At their departure, an irate Kofi questions why a nice boy like the boy says they greatly appreciate it, but Pearl continues that taking care of the sand. The girl stands with her hands and deviously replies, "With pleasure." Like, is any of this for real or not? The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he is sucked into it. He bats the darkness away and wakes up on a clear sunny day. He looks up and gasps. The boy turns around to face the other two weapons) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: Now, what will you give it form... (<br>
      <br>
    (A third pedestal appears in his hands) <br>

    Voice: The closer you get to the net towards her face.<br>
    <br>
    (The boy with a large flock of birds rise from the ground) <br>
    <br>
    Voice: But don't be afraid. And don't forget... <br>
    <br>

The next match is won by Kofi and Kiki to head over to the net while the boy and Nanefua lead the pufferfish towards the pufferfish.)<br>
    <br>
    Voice: Can you do it? <br>
    <br>

A meteor shower rains down from above as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand out as the boy sets up the power to fight.)<br>
    <br>
    ????: Gimme a break, Kairi.<br>
    <br>
    Kairi: Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.<br>

    <br>
    Kairi: Yeah, sure.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    (He slashes at the destruction of his shop's sign. As the boy hurries to greet them. Kofi grudgingly explains that their shop is closed today "because it's broken."
